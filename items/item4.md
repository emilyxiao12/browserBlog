## Art Mural

This is a art project that I did with another person that was a gift for the high school that I went to.

The base structure was a tree along with the bubbles (the leaves) and those bubbles had science concepts that would be learned from grades 9-12. Some of the concepts that was included was Mols, combustion, the structure of the heart, states of matter, atomic structures, electricity, and many more. 

# Issues 
All projects come with issues that prevents them to proceed with project. In this case it took my partner and I 2 months to get approval to paint on school property. But sadly it took us all the way to exam review day, which was the day of our graduation. We also stayed after school for many weeks and days to grind and finish the mural in time. 

## My Angle

When working on this project I could enhance my time management and communication skills in order to understand how my partner felt as we had many obstacles to overcome. By doing this I can understand other individuals perspectives, as we were in similar situations.
