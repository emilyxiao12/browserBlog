## My Mental Health Journey

This was a grade 12 art project that shows the journey of how someone's mental health is not always happy or good. The hand holding the shattered mask holding it towards the face resembles the fact that everyone is usually hiding behind a persona that is not actually what they act like. 

## My Angle

When working on this project I could enhance my ability to reflect back on the situations that I have been in the past and really focus on them. This can be my own actions, feelings, and my own internal thoughts.
