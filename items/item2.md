## UX 307: DESIGNING FOR INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY

# Summary
Overall, throughout this course I have come up with three separate ideas, one on inclusion, diversity, and a synthesized solution. The design solution for inclusion was on how individuals experience choosing a perfect pair of glasses for specifically people that cannot easily do some/or all the steps in getting a perfect pair of glasses. As for the diversity design solution I came up with haptic earbuds and other devices for everyone to experience music in a unique way that can be used by everyone. The synthesized solution is to combine my haptic solution with the inclusion solution to create the best solution.

On the other hand this is a design solution for enhancing the experience of using earbuds or your smartphone device. This can help with elderly, youth, or anyone that wants to experiences their smart devices or wireless earbuds in a different way such as haptic belts or sensors physically on the device.

This came with some challenges in coming up with solution such as making sure that I am not making another inclusion solution. So to avoid that kind of thinking I thought differently as, “how can I make this experience accessible and usable for not only the disabled, but every day individuals as well.” From there I was able to come up with the haptic solutions for our devices.

The synthesis design solution was a new way to experience the glasses selection at the optometrist. By doing this it helps solve the many design issues from the high selves, the long glass cabinets, etc.

## Review
The design process for the inclusion solution was at first quite difficult because even after my prof gave us so many ideas I was still struggling to find a design issue that I could relate to and easily tackle. When I was stuck I would write down as many as possible issues that come up in either my own daily routines or peers, and see if there was any common pains within the list. From that I found out that since most of my friends wear glasses I found out many common pain points that they experienced. So from there I went to my sketch book and tried to come up with as many ideas that could restrict someone from obtaining glasses. But I was still having a bit of trouble until I was talking with an upper year that was in game design he mentioned to think about some individuals that may not have speech, nerve damage, blindness, etc. After talking with him I finally came up with that final solution.

The design process for the diversity solution was a a bit more difficult because my mind was already set on designing for inclusion. So every time I come up with an idea there was a gut feeling that I did not design for diversity instead designing for inclusion. The initial process was to ideate as many issues that could concern diversity and did some infinity mapping by myself to see the common groups that had/has possible issues of diversity. Technology was a one of the bigger topics so I chose it and began to come up with more ideas that I could possibly implement.

## Concluding Evaluation
As for the synthesized solution, I just combined the inclusion and diversity solutions together to create a final visualization for the synthesized view. When coming up with the final solution I sketched out a bunch of combined designs, and just chose the one that I thought would best represent both inclusion and diversity.

For the design for both the inclusion and diversity design solutions I was challenged in way way that I had to put all my perceptions and interpretations that I had on someone that was under privileged, essentially keeping an open mind when thinking of them. From keeping an open mind I was able to execute the wanted possible solutions for both diversity and inclusion. Overall, I think the design process that I learned in a previous ux project helped me prepared for these design process that worked in this class. So there was not a lot of aspects that did not work, although the implementation of the synthesized solution would take a lot of time and money. I learned that from the design process to appreciate the time and effort put into each project given because it allows you evolve as a designer. This will help my evolution as an Inclusive Designer by keeping an open mind about going into a design project, trying considering everyone within each solution, designing with users not against.
