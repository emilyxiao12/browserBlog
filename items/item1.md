## Course Registration

The Laurier Registration project was given to us as our first ux project. I was working with five other students: Olivia Albin, Mason Wright, Simrit Dhillon, Elise Vanderwildt, and Yuki Xu.

## Project Overview
We were given the task from our clients Lori, Shelagh, and Jennifer, individuals who work within the administration and registration of Laurier. They came to us with two initial problems: not enough students were using the registration resources and tools and many emails and phone calls regarding registering for courses. Also, they told us that there were many restrictions within this project:

* Limited flexibility in what template can be used for the website
* Restricted colour choices
* Has to be within the schools budget

## Inspiration

In this phase, we went exploring and navigated different university platforms to see how their schools handled course registration, thinking of different ideas that we could bring to Laurier. From the research gathered from other schools we came up with a how might we question to help guide us in the project:

# How might we streamline the process of the course registration and reduce student confusion?

After that we went out and talked to our friends (in different programs/specializations) and upper year students to see if they had any outstanding issues when registering for courses. We also asked the students to participate in think-out-loud protocols and contextual inquiry. During these research methods and interviews we asked them specific questions that would address for their opinion/thoughts on the current guide and if they had any issues while registering.

## Issues we Encountered

But actually before doing any of the research methods we wanted to do a google form asking questions about their registration. Unfortunately, our professor rejected because by asking pre-determined questions restricted how a someones true opinions about the website. So we had to quickly move on and kept our mind open and went a different route, to the contextual inquiry and think-out-loud protocols.

## Journey Map

This is a journey map/ empathy map that we did in order to find out where most students had the most issues in. In order for the data to really stimulate the feeling of an incoming student we asked siblings and students from other universities.
