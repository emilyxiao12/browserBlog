## Art Sketch

As I wanted to start an art Instagram account I decided on drawing some fan art of an anime that I really loved to watch. It was my very first time working with the medium (Gel pens and fabric markers). 

## Process
In order to draw this I went onto Google and looked for references and two pictures of each character that is included with the picture shown. After that I went in and lightly sketched out the outline and from there went more in detail as time went on.

## My Angle

When working on this project I could enhance my sketching and drawing skills. By doing this I am able to increase my creative mindset in order to challenge myself in the future. Keeping myself in a creative mindset I will be able to make even better solutions.
