Hello! I my name is Emily Xiao and I am a current UX design student that attends Wilfrid Laurier University. 
It may not seem like I am a type of person that would pursue in an area of anything extremely intense activity, but I actually was a part of a few military youth groups. I was in Navy League (10-13 yrs old) and sea cadets (13-17 yrs old). Through these experiences I learned many skills that would benefit from working in the UX industry such as leadership, time management, communication, dependency, etc.

# Skills
I have have some experiences in Graphic Design, the adobe suite (XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, Spark), basic skills in HTML5, CSS, Markdown, and Javascript. But I have 3 years worth of knowledge of Javascript from highschool.
